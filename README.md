# YUV-Processor #

YUV-Processor is a team work (Lab4.1) of Computer Architecture. It is developed by [Kaihang Ji](https://github.com/mimicji) and [Jizhou Li](https://github.com/HeraclitusTheFirelord). All rights reserved.

Mainly it has two functions:

- Fade in and fade out one image.
- Create a gradient which overlays two images.

To choose an Instruction Set, choose a namespace from Non_Simd / MMX / AVX / SSE.
